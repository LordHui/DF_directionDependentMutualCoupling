These MATLAB codes are prepared for the paper:
A. M. Elbir, “Direction Finding in the Presence of Direction-Dependent Mutual Coupling," 
in IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, vol. 16, no. , pp. 1541-1544, 2017. doi: 10.1109/LAWP.2017.2647983


The MC transformation structure is also the same for the following paper:
A. M. Elbir, "A Novel Data Transformation Approach for DOA Estimation With 3-D Antenna Arrays in the Presence of Mutual Coupling,"
 in IEEE Antennas and Wireless Propagation Letters, vol. 16, no. , pp. 2118-2121, 2017. doi: 10.1109/LAWP.2017.2699292

Simply use the code estimate_MCM_DirectionDependent.m for MC transformation for any antenna array geometry, 
even 3-D randomly deployed arays.

If you use this code, please cite the above works.
